          <li>Singles and Doubles: Table Tennis can be played as singles (one player against another) or doubles (two players on each side). In doubles, players take turns hitting the ball.</li>
          <li>Serve: The game begins with a serve, where the ball is thrown up from an open palm and struck so that it bounces on the server's side of the table before crossing over the net.</li>
          <li>Rally: Players take turns hitting the ball back and forth over the net, aiming to score points by making the opponent fail to return the ball within the boundaries of the opponent's side of the table.</li>
          <li>Scoring: Points are scored when the opponent fails to return the ball, or the ball is hit out of bounds. Matches are typically played to 11 points (though variations exist), and a player must win by a margin of at least two points.</li>
